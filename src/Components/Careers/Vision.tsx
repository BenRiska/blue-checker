            Static websites, chatbots and social media are damaging the connection we have with our fellow man. The future is found in genuine, authentic B2C personalized conversational commerce.

            <br/>
            Ecommerce websites today only convert at 1-2%. 
            <br/>
            This 98% inefficiency function has the potential to be radically distrupted. We are poised to change the way businesses interact with their customers.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The future is the one we create. Join us as we play this game.
